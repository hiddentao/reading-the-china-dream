This is simply a "left-over" category for intellectuals and texts that do not fall into the three main groups. China's intellectual world is diverse, and the division into Liberals, New Left, and New Confucians in no way does it justice. But to the extent that this web site is a reference tool, multiplying the categories will not help users find what they need.
