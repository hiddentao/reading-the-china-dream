​All of these texts have been written by scholars who identify themselves as "Liberals" in one way or another, although their points of view and arguments range widely. "Liberal" in China can refer to Hayek supporters who demand free markets and property rights, to professors in the Central Party School of the Chinese Communist Party who nonetheless embrace constitutional democracy, to "near dissidents" who sound very much like Liu Xiaobo...and much more. Westerners tend to conflate Chinese "Liberals" with dissidents, but the reality is much for complex. Many Chinese Liberals support Donald Trump...
