**Voices from the Chinese Century**  
  
The essays translated in this [volume](http://cup.columbia.edu/book/voices-from-the-chinese-century/9780231195232), published by Columbia University Press in 2019, are from some of the best minds in China today. The focus of their concerns is China itself: Where has it come from? What is it today? What should it be in the future? The collection is edited by Timothy Cheek, David Ownby, and Joshua Fogel and the translations include those of the editors, as well as others produced by Western and Chinese graduate students and junior scholars who received [training ](/training/)in the larger Reading the China Dream [project](/about/).

The Chinese scholars and public intellectuals translated in this volume rest heavily on history, framed by Gan Yang’s well-known challenge to “integrate the three traditions” of China’s modern history: Confucianism, liberalism, and socialism. They give three clearly different narratives of the same China over the past century to justify their competing visions for the China Dream. In the process they offer a powerful critique not only of Maoism but also of liberal democracy in the 21st century. For the New Confucians the failures of socialism and the depredations of Western “hollowing out of Chinese culture” in the 20th century cry out for a traditional Chinese solution—Confucianism. The same world according to Chinese liberals is one of socialist failure and market success now challenged by the lack of political reform. These challenges cry out for the best political solutions human civilizations have produced, and liberalism has the best track record in modern history. For New Left intellectuals only the Chinese state, as a reformed socialist entity, has the wherewithal to withstand the depredations of neo-Liberal globalization.  
  
It is the disagreements, as well as underlying shared assumptions, of these thoughtful and fractious intellectuals that provides a richer and more complex understanding of China today and its role in our future. We have selected writings that we, the editors, in conjunction with our Chinese colleagues in the PRC, feel capture the diversity of intelligent opinion about just what is, or should be, the “Chinese Dream.”
