Chinese public intellectuals divide their world into three basic groups, defined by intellectual affiliation: [**Liberals,**](/liberals/) [**New Left**](/new-left/), and [**New Confucians.**](/new-confucians/) The reality is of course more complex, as there are divisions within the groups, overlapping concerns shared by members of competing groups, and any number of people who fall outside of the groups. But as a basic map of the world of public intellectuals, the three groups have their utility.  
  
This menu thus sorts the intellectuals whose texts we have translated according to group, adding an [**“other”**](/others/) category for those who do not fit. We hope this will be useful to those interested in understanding the basic arguments of the groups.
