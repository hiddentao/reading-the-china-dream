Toward the end of 2020, Freya Ge, a high school senior in Shanghai, wrote to me to ask if she could contribute to the web site as part of her education and civil engagement, and I was delighted to say yes. We agreed that she would seek out texts of concern to today's Chinese youth, and that we would translate and curate them together. I will post them here as they become available.
