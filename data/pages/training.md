The project out of which this website grew also had a training dimension. With the expiration of the grant in 2019, we no longer have the funds necessary to finance this part of the project, which means that this "training" has for the moment been largely suspended--although Timothy Cheek continues to run "history labs" (see below) informally at the University of British Columbia. Nonetheless, our experiment was rewarding and successful, and I will leave the description of what we did here to perhaps inspire others.   
  
Building on a long-standing institutional affiliation between the University of British Columbia and East China Normal University, the project paired Canadian graduate students (and eventually Australians and others, as well, as our network expanded) with Chinese graduate students and young scholars, to work on translation and other projects. Our objectives were multiple.   
  
First, translation itself is hardly a “mechanical” exercise. Translating well requires considerable historical and cultural knowledge, as well as sensitivity to linguistic nuance and style in both languages. Working in tandem helps both the Westerner and the Chinese, who would often like to be able to publish in English, a daunting task.   
  
Second, collaborative translation builds relationships, which are at the heart of networking and scholarship, and provides access for both Western and Chinese scholars to institutional and personal resources which can otherwise take years to obtain. Given the state of technology in our globalized world, scholarship requires these resources, and we were proud to be able to help our students get a leg up.

(N.B. Several of these institutional affiliations are surely out of date. Appearances to the contrary, graduate students do finish their degrees and move on).  
  
Concretely, we carried out collaborative translation through the mechanism of what we called “History Labs,” which were conversations, via Skype or similar communication technologies, about texts. Each team of translators, under the supervision of one of the professors involved in the project, worked through an assigned text. History Labs stimulated exchanges about the translation and about the text, and once again served also to build relationships. Many of the texts translated through the History Labs appeared in the volume [Voices from the Chinese Century](/voices-from-chinas-century/) (Columbia, 2019).  
  
History Labs also produced a series of essays that map of state of the field in studies of Chinese establishment intellectuals, published in _China Information_:
