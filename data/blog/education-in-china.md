New on the site, four rousing essays on the subject of education.  
  
Gan Yang and Liu Xiaofeng offer a withering condemnation of Beida’s 2014 plans to launch the English-language only Yenching Academy, in “[The Cultural Positioning and Self-Betrayal of Peking University](/gan-yang-and-liu-xiaofeng-on-yenching-academy/)”  
  
Tsinghua Political Scientist Liu Yu denounces China’s “educational arms race” in “[My Daughter is Inexorably Becoming an Ordinary Person](/liu-yu-on-the-arms-race-in-chinese-education/)”  
  
Social Anthropologist Xiang Biao talks about his experiences as a student at Beida in the early 1990s in [excerpts](/xiang-biao-excerpts-from-self-as-method/) from his book _Self as Method_.  
  
The Taiwanese Sociologist Zhao Gang discusses “radicalism and violence” among youth in Taiwan and Hong Kong in “[Why is this Generation of Young People so Easily Tricked?](/zhao-gang-radical-youth-in-taiwan-and-hong-kong/)” **N. B. I did not choose this text because I agree with it.**  
  
I might mention that I was a recent guest on the [Chinese Whispers Podcast](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdWRpb2Jvb20uY29tL2NoYW5uZWxzLzUwMjg2NzIucnNz/episode/dGFnOmF1ZGlvYm9vbS5jb20sMjAyMS0wNC0xOTovcG9zdHMvNzg0NzYxNQ?hl=en-CA&ved=2ahUKEwjpovaa2arwAhXRZs0KHeq0AckQjrkEegQIExAF&ep=6), hosted by The Spectator in the U.K. Even if you have heard enough of me, I highly recommend the podcast. Cindy Yu, the journalist who runs it, asks excellent questions and gives her guests the chance to answer them.
