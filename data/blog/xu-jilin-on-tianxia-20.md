New on the website this week:   
Xu Jilin, "[The New Tianxia: Rebuilding China's Internal and External Order](/xu-jilin-the-new-tianxia/)"  
  
Like Ge Zhaoguang's "[If Horses had Wings](/ge-zhaoguang-if-horses-had-wings/)," Xu's essay is a response to New Confucians and others who insist on the "uniqueness" of China's civilization. But where Ge attacks Mainland New Confucians head on, Xu attempts a reappropriation of China's tradition for liberal ends. Enjoy!  
  
Coming soon: Xu Zhangrun on "China's Moment in World History" and Qin Hui on "Only China Can Save Socialism"
