New on the site this time:  
  
​Jiang Shigong discusses the American “legal empire” that made the [Meng Wanzhou case](/jiang-shigong-on-meng-wanzhou/) possible.  
  
We offer a third, and for the moment, final text by Wang Huning, Politiburo member and arguably China’s most powerful intellectual, “[Cultural Expansion and Cultural Sovereignty](/wang-huning-ldquocultural-expansion-and-cultural-sovereignty/).” The translation is once again a collaboration between me and Matthew D. Johnson, Founder and Principal of [AltaSilva LLC](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnsonmatthewd).  
  
Matt Dean translates Gan Yang and Liu Xiaofeng on “[Re-reading the West](/gan-yang-and-liu-xiaofeng-re-reading-the-west/).”  
  
Finally, a recording of a talk I gave in Germany in early October on “China’s Changing Intellectual Landscape,” together with Sarah Eaton, Xiang Biao, and Ian Johnson, is available [here](https://www.eth.mpg.de/5597703/reflexive%5Fbrokerage%5Ffor%5Fa%5Fglobal%5Fanthropology) (scroll down to find the recording).  
  
Enjoy!
