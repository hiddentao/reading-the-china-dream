​New on the site this time:  
  
A collaboration with [GreatFire](https://en.greatfire.org/) on [Reading and Writing under Censorship in China](/censorship-in-china/). GreatFire is an anonymous and award-winning China-based organization that works to bring transparency to online censorship and to help Chinese people freely access information. One thing that they do is to rescue posts that have been suppressed on various platforms in China, making them newly available to anyone with access to their sites. Over the summer, I will translate several such texts in an effort to understand how intellectuals and editors deal with what looks to be a fairly random system where pretty much everyone gets taken down at some point. I start with translations of texts by [Liu Qing](/liu-qing-on-intellectual-factualism/) and [Yao Yang](/yao-yang-interview-on-chinese-economy-2023/).  
  
I might mention as well that I published a piece a couple of weeks ago on “[How China’s New Left Embraced the State](https://chinabooksreview.com/2024/05/16/how-chinas-new-left-embraced-the-state/)” in _China Books Review_, a new journal edited by Alec Ash that everyone should be reading!
