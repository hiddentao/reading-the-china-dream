New on the site this fortnight, Qin Hui, “[Globalization after the Pandemic: Thoughts on the Coronavirus](/qin-hui-globalization-after-the-pandemic/),” a long and fascinating text by one of China’s most famous liberals which, to my knowledge, has not yet been published in Chinese. Qin sent me the text in mid-October, asking me to translate it. The essay pursues Qin’s decades-long reflections on the relationship between human rights and globalization in ways that readers are likely to find sobering, if not disturbing.  
​  
Given the importance of Qin’s text, I decided to translate it (my English translation) into [Spanish](/qin-hui-ldquoglobalizacioacuten-despueacutes-de-la-pandemia/) and [French](/qin-hui-ldquola-mondialisation-apres-la-pandemie/) as well, an idea I have been toying with for some time. [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator), a translation program, does a remarkable job when translating between related European languages, and colleagues who are native-speakers of the languages helped me to prepare the final version. Cristina Reigadas of the University of Buenos Aires—who has recently launched her own [China Dream blog](https://chinatodobajoelcielo.blogspot.com/)​—handled the Spanish, and Laurence Monnais, my colleague at the Université de Montréal did the French.  
  
If followers of Reading the China Dream are interested in participating in such translation efforts, send me an email and we’ll explore possibilities.
