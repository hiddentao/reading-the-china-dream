New on the site, Lao Dongyan, Professor of Law at Tsinghua University, on “[The Hidden Dangers of Facial Recognition Technology](/lao-dongyan-artificial-intelligence/).” This is not a scholarly article, but rather a post on Professor Lao’s WeChat platform offering her personal and professional opinion of the expanding use of facial recognition technology, but it is interesting both for what she says and for the fact that she said it in China.

Enjoy and STAY SAFE!!
