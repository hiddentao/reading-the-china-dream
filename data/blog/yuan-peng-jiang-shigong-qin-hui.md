New on the site this time:  
  
​Yuan Peng, “[Fundamental Principles Maintaining and Shaping National Security in the New Era—Studying the _Outline of the Comprehensive National Security Concept_](/yuan-peng-on-comprehensive-national-security/)”. Yuan is both an establishment intellectual and a part of the Party-State national security apparatus. Here he writes as the latter, in the _People’s Daily_.  
  
Jiang Shigong, “[Commerce and Human Rights (Part Two)—Sino-American Competition in the Context of World Empire](/jiang-shigong-on-commerce-and-human-rights-part-2/)”. This is part two of Jiang’s commentary on the history of commerce and human rights in the liberal world order, in which he extends his analysis to the postwar and contemporary periods.  
  
I am also continuing to translate Qin Hui’s chronicles of the war in Ukraine (7 have been published so far on FT-Chinese, which is pay walled) because his denunciations of Russian aggression and Western appeasement recall similar warnings in the period leading up to WWII: "[’Nazify’ or ‘Denazify?’ Ukraine Commentary No. 3](/qin-hui-ukraine-3/)”, and “[The Russia-Ukraine War and the Soviet-Finnish ‘Winter War’—Ukraine Commentary No. 4](/qin-hui-ukraine-4/)”.  
  
Enjoy!
