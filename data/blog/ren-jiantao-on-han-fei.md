New on the site this time:  
  
Only one text: Ren Jiantao “[Han Fei and the Theoretical Gestalt of Operationalized Politics](/ren-jiantao-han-fei-and-the-theoretical-gestalt-of-operationalized-politics/),” long and a bit contentious, but worth a look!  
  
Otherwise, I have started my career as a retired world traveler, visiting Colombia for two weeks in early October before flying to Switzerland to settle into my new life in Lausanne. Turns out I fractured my ankle in the mountains of Colombia just before leaving (sounds more Harrison Ford than it was), so my mobility is a bit limited, but I will still visit Paris for my [book launch](https://www.librairielephenix.fr/post/5069/rencontre-avec-david-ownby-pour-une-presentation-dedicace-de-son-livre-l-essor-de-la-chine-et-les-intellectuels-publics-chinois) (ooh la la!) on November 17, and will try to give a couple of talks and see friends while I’m there.  
  
I am also launching a travel/retirement blog entitled “[The Red-Eye to Bogotá](https://redeyetobogota.com/),” in which I try to become a writer. I welcome you to be a reader!
