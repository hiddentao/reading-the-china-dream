​New on the site this time:  
  
Deng Yuwen, “[Xi Jinping’s Regime is the Twilight of Totalitarianism](/deng-yuwen-on-xi-jinpings-totalitarianism/).”  
  
Only one text this time, because I’ve been busy with other things, but the piece is well worth reading in the gloomy context of the recently concluded 20th Party Congress.  
  
Also, I mentioned last time that Xiao Biao’s _Self as Method_, translated by yours truly, has just come out on Palgrave. I don’t think I mentioned that it is Open Access, and hence free as a digital document. Some 118,000 people have downloaded it so far. Click [here](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-19-4953-1) if you are interested.  
  
Enjoy!
