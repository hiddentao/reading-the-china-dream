New on the site this time:   
  
​Zheng Yongnian on [Sino-American relations](/zheng-yongnian-on-the-balloon-incident/) in the wake of the “balloon incident.” Zheng wants China to take action to return stability to the relationship, but understandably has a hard time coming up with concrete suggestions.  
  
Zhang Tianqi offers a nice piece of critical journalism on the “[Hengshui model](/zhang-tianqi-on-hengshui-high-school/)” in the Chinese educational system—super high schools that game the system to monopolize the best students and the best teachers and send more of their students to the best universities—at the expense of everyone else. This piece is more interesting than Zheng Yongnian’s essay, but memories of the spy balloon are still fresh.  
  
Finally, an [interview with Liang Hong](/liang-hong-on-feminism/), the non-fiction writer best known for her Liang Village Trilogy. The interview comes from a new volume on female scholars in academia that caught my eye.  
  
Enjoy!
