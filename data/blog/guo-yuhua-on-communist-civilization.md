Happy Year of the Pig!  
  
Just added to the site, another piece by liberal sociologist Guo Yuhua: "[The Shadow of 'Chinese Civilization](/guo-yuhua-communist-civilization/).'" This is a 2013 interview with the website Gongshiwang to publicize the publication of her book _The Narrative of Those Who Suffer: The History of Ji Village and Those Who Suffer._ Double irony--the book was published in Hong Kong due to its critical stance, and Gongshiwang was closed down by authorities in October 2016\. Thus it would seem that Guo can still speak, but has a hard time being heard.  
  
In a couple of weeks, another essay by Qin Hui.
