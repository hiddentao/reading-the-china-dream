New on the site, "[What Has Xi Jinping Wrought?](/david-ownby-what-has-xi-jinping-wrought/)", a follow-up to the last update's piece on "[Am I Being Played?](/david-ownby-am-i-being-played/)", in which I once again use Ren Jiantao's writings, this time from 2020, to try to measure the impact Xi Jinping's reimposition of ideological discipline has had on the world of China's establishment intellectuals.

In addition, one final essay by Ren Jiantao, this one on the theme of artificial intelligence: "[An Ounce of Prevention: Technological Revolution and Great Changes to State Governance](/ren-jiantao-an-ounce-of-prevention/)."
