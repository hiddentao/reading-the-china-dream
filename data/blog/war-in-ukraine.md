New on the site this time, four texts on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine:  
  
Zheng Yongnian, “[The War in Ukraine Blurs the Two Main Lines, But Many People Misunderstand China's Role](/zheng-yongnian-ukraine-and-the-new-world-order/).” Zheng’s text is close to some of what we read in official propaganda, suggesting that China might be able to take advantage of the conflict, but he still counsels extreme caution.  
  
Sun Liping, “[The Small Chess Board and the Big Picture: Russia in the Big Picture May Be Ukraine on the Small Chess Board](/sun-liping-russia-ukraine-and-the-big-picture/).” Sun’s text was taken down by authorities (and reposted elsewhere), presumably for arguing that China should absolutely not get in bed with Russia, which is not only in the wrong morally, but which will soon be the object of a world-wide anti-Russia alliance. This alliance might well be turned against China, since Russia is a minor power in decline.  
  
Finally, two texts by Qin Hui, “[The West's ‘Double Standard’ and Putin's ‘Single Standard’—From the Crimean Crisis to Putin's February 21 Declaration](/qin-hui-on-ukraine--1/),” and “[Ukraine Series No. 2: Aggression and Appeasement—Crimea and the Sudetenland Compared](/qin-hui-on-ukraine--2/).” In the Chinese intellectual context, Qin’s texts are unrepresentative, because his goal is to completely demolish any justification for the Russian invasion and to call the world’s attention to the similarities between Putin and Hitler.  
  
More soon.
