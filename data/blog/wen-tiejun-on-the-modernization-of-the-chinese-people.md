New on the site this time:  
  
Wen Tiejun’s “[The Modernization of the Chinese People](/wen-tiejun-on-chinas-modernization/),” a rousing essay originally published in 2000 and reprinted by two Chinese media outlets during the 20th Party Congress. Wen’s message? “China needs jobs!”  
  
Also, a recent [talk](/yao-yang-on-chinas-economy/) by Peking University economist Yao Yang on the resilience of China’s economy, with interesting things to say about semiconductors and covid policy.  
  
​Enjoy!
