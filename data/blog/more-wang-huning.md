New this time around:  
  
​A follow-up text by Wang Huning, Politiburo member and arguably China’s most powerful intellectual, “[The Structure of China’s Changing Political Culture](/wang-huning-ldquothe-structure-of-chinarsquos-changing-political-culturerdquo/).” The translation is once again a collaboration between me and Matthew D. Johnson, Founder and Principal of [AltaSilva LLC](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnsonmatthewd). We will post at least one more Wang Huning text in October.  
  
Selena Orly and I also translated an [interview](/liang-hong-interview/) with the well-known non-fiction writer Liang Hong. Liang’s third book on the Henan village where she grew up , _Liang Village Ten Years On_ [梁庄十年](https://book.douban.com/subject/35309286/)​, was published earlier this year in China. The English translation of her first book, _[China in One Village](https://www.versobooks.com/books/3779-china-in-one-village)_ 中国在梁庄 was published this year, and I highly recommend it.  
  
A third text, Zhou An’an, “[The Supreme Court Finally Overturned the Idea that ‘996 is a Blessing,’ but Did not Address the Larger Problems of the Platform Economy](/zhou-anan-from-utopia-to-leviathan/),” is one example among many of establishment intellectuals reflecting on inequality and other economic problems in China as Xi Jinping and the Party center strike out at China’s rich and famous.  
  
Finally, an addition to our Spanish-language transations: '[Filosofía e Historia: Interpretando la "Era Xi Jinping" a través del Informe de Xi Jinping al Decimonoveno Congreso Nacional del PCCh](/jiang-shigong-filosofia-e-historia/)'. _Gracias_ to _Nicolás Cornejo Castellanos_ for helping to make this important text available in Spanish.  
  
Those interested in Shi Zhan, whom I have mentioned before on this blog, might want to read my [review](https://erccs.hypotheses.org/) of his most recent book, _Breaking out of the Cocoon_, on the blog of the [European Research Centre for Chinese Studies](https://erccs.hypotheses.org/about), a very interesting publication.   
  
I am also delighted to share the news that my friend and colleague, David Kelly of [China Policy](https://policycn.com/team/david-kelly/), is launching his own translation blog, [Beijing Baselines](https://beijingbaselines.substack.com/). Check it out!
