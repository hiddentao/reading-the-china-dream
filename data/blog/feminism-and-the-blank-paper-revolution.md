New on the site this time:  
  
A dazzling [essay](/luuml-pin-on-feminism-and-the-blank-paper-revolution/) by feminist activist Lü Pin on feminism and the blank paper revolution which effectively brought China’s zero-covid policy to an end;  
  
The [eighth of Qin Hui’s essays](/qin-hui-ldquowho-blew-up-the-kakhovka-dam/) on the Russia-Ukraine war, this one on the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam—in which he scoops the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/06/16/world/europe/ukraine-kakhovka-dam-collapse.html);  
  
Wu Chaojin and Zhang Jingrong on [“goofing off” at work](/wu-chaojin-and-zhang-jinrong-on-goofing-off/), a further addition to our project on Chinese youth concerns.  
  
By the way, if you missed me on Kaiser Kuo’s Sinica podcast on June 8, you can give a belated listen [here](https://thechinaproject.com/podcast/david-ownby-of-readingthechinadream-com-on-the-intellectual-mood-in-china/).  
  
À propos of nothing at all, if there are elliptical aficionados among my readers, I _highly_ recommend Chancha Via Circuito’s “Río Arriba” (available on Spotify) as musical accompaniment. Put on your headphones, close your eyes, turn up the music, and you will be loping across the Argentinian Pampas before you know it. You can be the mustang or the cowgirl/cowboy, your choice.   
  
​Enjoy!
