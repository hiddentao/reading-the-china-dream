New on the site this time:  
  
Xu Jilin reflects on the “silence” of the Shanghai lockdown in a [talk](/xu-jilin-on-the-shanghai-lockdown/) with the Chinese branch of the PEN organization in June of 2022, a few weeks after the lockdown was lifted.  
  
Chen Zhiwu talks about how “risk avoidance” has shaped the course of civilization, in an [interview](/chen-zhiwu-on-risk-advoidance-and-civilization/) with _Southern People Weekly_ on the occasion of the publication of Chen’s _The Logic of Civilization_ (2022).  
  
​Enjoy!
