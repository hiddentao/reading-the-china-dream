New on the site: Chen Ming, "[The Road to Confucian Civil Religion](/chen-ming-confucian-civil-religion/)," a 2010 interview with one of China's best-known Mainland New Confucians. Although less than ten years old, Chen's arguments here are very different from his more recent [denunications](/chen-ming-transcend-left-and-right/) of both liberalism and socialism, and Chen imagines a Confucian civil religion that could heal China's ethnic tensions and coexist with liberal democracy. For more on the contemporary history of the Mainland New Confucians, see Stephen Angle, ed., “The Adolescence of Mainland New Confucianism,” _Contemporary Chinese Thought_, vol. 49 (2018), which contains translations of texts by Chen and others.
