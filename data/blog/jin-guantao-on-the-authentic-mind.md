What do you do if you are a Chinese establishment intellectual, journalist, or editor, and you CANNOT WRITE ABOUT the biggest protests in China since Tiananmen? I read the tea leaves in today’s update :  
  
Jin Guantao, “[The Mentality of Many People Today Marks a Return to the 19th Century](/jin-guantao-and-the-authentic-mind/)”; and  
  
Luo Minmin, “[The Epidemic Will Eventually End, But How Should We Deal with the Trauma of Social Depression?](/luo-minmin-on-covid-and-depression/)”  
​  
Enjoy!|
