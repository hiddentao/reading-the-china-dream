New additions to the site this time :  
​  
“[Historical Nihilism](/wang-yuhang-ldquothe-lsquopast-and-present-livesrsquo-of-historical-nihilismrdquo/),” a nasty little bit of propaganda aimed at establishment intellectuals, which we may be hearing more about in the run-up to the celebration of the CCP’s 100-year birthday in July.  
  
For our Youth Concerns project, a nice journalistic essay on [young people and…mutual funds](/xiao-shuyan-chasing-mutual-funds/).  
  
For our Women’s Voices project, Zuo Fengrong, Professor at the Central Party School, on “[The Thucydides Trap and a New Type of Great Power Relationship](/zuo-fengrong-ldquothe-thucydides-trap/).”  
  
And finally, Shi Zhan, historian and foreign relations expert on his new book, [Breaking through the Cocoon](/shi-zhan-breaking-through-the-cocoon/), which I would really like to read if anyone could get their hands on a copy.
