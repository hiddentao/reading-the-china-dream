​New on the site, Zhang Yongle, “[The Harm of Studying Abroad](/zhang-yongle-the-harm-of-studying-abroad/).” Zhang is a colleague of Jiang Shigong at Beijing University’s School of Law and, like Jiang, a prominent member of the New Left. The text translated here is neither formal nor academic, but instead a brief reflection Zhang posted on the web a few years back in which he criticizes the near universal ambition of Chinese students to study abroad. Why? Because it makes you lazy, harms your ability to communicate in Chinese, and takes you away from where contemporary history is being made—China. Much of Zhang’s argument is tongue-in-cheek, but his attitude is still representative of the arrogance China’s rise has inspired among some intellectuals.

Enjoy Zhang’s text as a stocking-stuffer for the busy end-of-term/holiday season! More of Liang Zhiping and “Imagining Tianxia” in the coming weeks.
