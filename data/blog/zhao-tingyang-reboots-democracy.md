New on the site:  
  
​Philosopher Zhao Tingyang, famous for his “tianxia system,” seeks to use ancient Chinese wisdom to “reboot” democracy in his “[A Feasible Smart Democracy](/zhao-tingyang-on-democracy/).”  
  
In addition, in the context to the run-up to the 100-year anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party next month, two texts illustrating the overlap between propaganda and the work of establishment intellectuals:  
  
Zhang Cheng, “[The Methodology of the Chinese Path: China as Center and Method](/zhang-cheng-china-as-center-and-method/)”  
  
Zhang Xianming, “[The Logic of the Politics of Responsibility in Full-Process Democracy](/zhang-xianming-on-full-process-democracy/)”  
  
Finally, a text for our “Women’s Voices” project: Chang Yinting and Yang Xia, “[Feminist Discourse: Its Chinese Context and Contemporary Value](/chang-yinting-and-yang-xia-on-feminist-discourse/)”  
  
Enjoy!
