Our modest contribution to the celebration of the May Fourth movement's hundredth birthday is a translation of a _People's Daily_ editorial on the subject by an establishment intellectual: Zheng Shiqu, “[Encourage the Broad Masses of Youth to Work Tirelessly for National Rejuvenation](/zheng-shiqu-encourage-the-broad-masses-of-youth/)”. As the title suggests, the editorial is not critical.   
  
Thanks to Bill Bishop's [Sinocism](https://sinocism.com/) for the reference to Zheng. If you're not reading Sinocism, you should be!
