New on the site this month, Yuan Ling, "​​[Outside Beijing’s Sixth Ring Road: The Vagrant Life of a Family with Five Off-Plan Children](/yuan-ling-outside-beijings-sixth-ring-road/)." Yuan Ling (b. 1973), is a journalist and non-fiction writer. The text translated here is drawn from his recently published book, _Silent Children_ 寂静的孩子 (2019), in which he describes, in ethnographic detail, the lives of poor and underprivileged children in many parts of China. This excerpt, the subject of which is a family of seven migrant workers struggling in the far Beijing suburbs, complements Qin Hui's [study of China and South Africa](/qin-hui-looking-at-china-from-south-africa1/) by illustrating how constant urban renewal projects make the lives of migrant workers unbearable.
