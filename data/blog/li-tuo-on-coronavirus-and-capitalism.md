New on the site this fortnight, Li Tuo, “The Riddle of the Twenty-First Century: Interview on the Coronavirus Crisis and Contemporary Capitalism.” I have removed this piece from my site at the request of the author, who had already arranged translation and publication on another platform, boundary2\. The text is available [here](https://www.boundary2.org/2021/01/the-pandemic-and-contemporary-capitalism-an-interview-with-tuo-li/).  
  
Enjoy.
