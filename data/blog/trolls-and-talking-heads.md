​New on the site this time:  
  
For our “Youth Concerns” rubric, Freya Ge and I translate a [Youthology piece](/youthology-on-language-polarization/) on polarization and hate speech on China’s internet.  
  
In addition, I translate a [conversation](/liu-yu-and-murong-xuecun-on-public-intellectuals/) between political scientist Liu Yu and writer Murong Xuecong on the stigmatization of the term “establishment intellectual.” This piece reads like it was from another era, because it was published on the Chinese-language version of the _New York Times_ web site in 2013, and stands as a reminder of how much certain things have changed.  
  
Finally, an [interview](/yang-kuisong-facing-up-to-chinas-revolution/) with historian Yang Kuisong, who is part of an important group of scholars in China who have begun to treat the Chinese revolution and the process of nation-building as _history_, bringing admirable sophistication and objectivity to their work.  
  
Department of shameless self-promotion:  
  
I recently published a piece on “[China’s Intellectual Ecology](https://palladiummag.com/2021/09/21/chinese-intellectual-ecology/)” in [Palladium](https://palladiummag.com/about/), a dynamic new journal concerned with the future of governance.  
​  
I will be traveling to Germany (!) next week, where I will participate in two online events: “[Understanding China in Uncertain Times](https://www.chinacentre.ox.ac.uk/am%5Fevent/understanding-china-in-uncertain-times/),” on October 5, hosted by the Oxford Center, and “[The Changing Intellectual Landscape in China](https://www.facebook.com/events/1017917525441558/?ref=newsfeed),” on October 6, hosted by the Berlin Contemporary China Network. The times will not work for everyone, obviously, but the events will be recorded and I will post the links when they are available.
