New this fortnight: Chinese intellectuals who support Trump. I had encountered such people in passing before, and dismissed them as strategic thinkers of the “the-enemy-of-my-enemy-is-my-friend” variety, in other words, Liberals who hoped Trump would be a thorn in Xi Jinping’s side. But having read Lin Yao’s fascinating piece on “[Beaconism and the Trumpian Metamorphosis of Chinese Liberal Intellectuals](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract%5Fid=3538736),” and having discussed the issue with the _Wall Street Journal_’s [Sha Hua](https://www.wsj.com/news/author/sha-hua), who is writing her own piece on the question, I decided to take a closer look. The three texts translated from Liberal authors offer variations on a theme: the sociologist [Sun Liping](/sun-liping-trumprsquos-attack-on-political-correctness/) praises Trump for attacking political correctness, comparing this attack to the “liberate thought” movement in China in the early 1980s, and suggesting that both represent a return to “normal;” legal scholar [Wang Jianxun](/wang-jianxun-american-spirit/) praises Trump for restoring the “American spirit,” which he defines as “Ayn Rand plus the Bible;” the well-known constitutional scholar [Gao Quanxi](/gao-and-tian-naturalization-and-conservative-constitutionalism/) (together with his colleague Tian Feilong) sees both Trump’s election and Brexit in England as the return of a sensible “Burkean” conservatism, successfully challenging a “borderless” expansion of rights discourse. The fourth text, by the well-known New Left political scientist [Cui Zhiyuan](/cui-zhiyuan-comparing-bannon-and-dugin/) reveals a surprising fascination with former Trump advisor Steve Bannon. No author mentions Trump’s anti-China rhetoric, and all treat Trump’s rhetoric with what to me was a suprising seriousness.
