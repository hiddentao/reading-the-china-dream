New on the site this month, Ge Zhaoguang on “[Imagining 'All Under Heaven:' the Political, Intellectual and Academic Background of a New Utopia](/ge-zhaoguang-tianxia-and-utopia/),” a follow-up to the [longer piece on tianxia](/liang-zhiping-tianxia-and-ideology/) by Liang Zhiping that we published in February. Liang in fact cites Ge as a prominent critic of tianxia thought and theorists, and Ge’s article is of a piece with his [scathing takedown of Mainland New Confucians](/ge-zhaoguang-if-horses-had-wings/) published somewhat later. Both texts argue that neither tianxia nor the New Confucian program has any genuine grounding in history. Both are instead political projects masquerading as cultural conservatism.  
​  
I was wondering whether to translate Ge’s piece on tianxia when I discovered that it had already been translated by Michael and Josephine Chiu-Duke of the University of British Columbia. Our warm thanks to them for letting us publish it here.
