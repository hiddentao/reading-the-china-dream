New on the site this fortnight, three texts that, paradoxically, remind us of the role of the market in the lives of contemporary Chinese public intellectuals. Legal scholar [Liang Zhiping ](/liang-zhiping-law-and-traditional-culture/)flogs two new books he published last year on the relationship between law and China's tradition in an excellent interview in _The Shanghai Review of Books_ (the equivalent of NYRB); sociologist [Sun Liping](/sun-liping-2021/) talks to fund managers about what to expect in 2021; and political scientist [Ren Jiantao](/ren-jiantao-chinese-values-and-utiltarianism/) talks to a think tank about the crisis in Chinese values.  
​  
One housekeeping note. At the request of the author, I removed from the site my translation of Li Tuo's piece on "The Pandemic and the Crisis of Contemporary Capitalism" because he had already made separate translation plans. The text is available [here](https://www.boundary2.org/2021/01/the-pandemic-and-contemporary-capitalism-an-interview-with-tuo-li/).
