Only one new text on the site this time around: Wang Mingyuan, “[Why Have Repeated Efforts to Revitalize the Northeast Failed? Rethinking the Twentieth Anniversary of the Strategy of Revitalizing the Old Industrial Base Areas](/wang-mingyuan-on-chinas-northeast/).” Wang, a law professor at Tsinghua, seeks to explain the Northeast region’s persist economic underperformance during reform and opening, and interestingly warns that all of China may be headed in the same direction, given declining birth rates in China and trends toward economic sovereignty throughout the world.  
  
Enjoy, and have a safe and happy holiday season!
