New on the site this time:  
  
Translations of two texts by Zhao Yanjing, the feisty urban planner from Xiamen University in Fujian:  
  
“[Should We Bail Out Local Government Debt? If So, How?](/zhao-yanjing-on-bailing-out-local-government-debt/)”  
  
“[What We Should Do in Response to American’s Technological Decoupling?](/zhao-yanjing-on-high-tech-tit-for-tat/)”   
  
​Enjoy!
