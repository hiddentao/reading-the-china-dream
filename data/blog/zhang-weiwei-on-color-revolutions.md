New on the site this time:  
  
Two short propaganda pieces that perhaps convey something of the mood in some intellectual circles as the opening of the 20th Congress looms:  
  
Zhang Weiwei, “[Creating Chaos and Turmoil, the Myth of American Democracy is shattered—The United States Incites "Color Revolutions" and Endangers World Peace and Stability](/zhang-weiwei-on-color-revolutions/)”, and  
  
Chen Ping, “[What’s Wrong with America’s Global Strategy?](/chen-ping-on-americas-global-strategy/)”  
  
Also, a brief document by the sociologist and public intellectual Lü Dewen on the Tangshan beating incident that occurred in June, sparking a huge Internet debate on sexual harassment and gendered violence in China:  
  
Lü Dewen, “[Why an ‘Ordinary’ Case Touched the Nerve of Society as a Whole: A Sociological Approach to Analysis—The Case of the Tangshan Beating Incident](/luuml-dewen-on-the-tangshan-beating-incident/)”.  
  
I might mention that I am currently writing a book, based largely on materials on my site, on how Chinese establishment intellectuals view the United States, as a geopolitical competitor, as as model of democratic government (sometimes positive, sometimes negative), and consequently as a mirror for Chinese thinkers trying to understand China’s recent past and future trajectory as a rising superpower. Because of time constraints, contributions to my blog over the next few months may be shorter and fewer than in the past, as well as focused on plugging perceived holes in my data base or narrative.
