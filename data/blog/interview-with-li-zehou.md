New on the site:  
  
An [interview with Li Zehou](/interview-with-li-zehou/), one of modern China’s most towering intellectual figures, published in Southern People Weekly. Li died earlier this month in Boulder, Colorado at the age of 91.  
  
A [text](/li-qiang-on-recent-changes-in-chinese-society/) by the Tsinghua sociologist Li Qiang on how China’s social structure has changed over the course of the first two decades of the 21st century.  
  
An [article](/chen-ruiyan-on-rural-home-construction/) by a Wuhan University graduate student, Chen Ruiyan, on how difficult it is to build houses in China’s villages. The article was inspired by a recent murder in Fujian, provoked by a housing dispute.  
  
And finally, for our “Youth Concerns” rubric, a [text](/su-qinian-sexually-suggestive-images-on-childrens-clothing/) on the topic of sexually suggestive clothing peddled by certain Chinese companies. This text was translated by Hannah Wang, a student in Guangzhou, who has recently joined our team. Welcome aboard, Hannah!  
  
For readers who are using our site in part for language learning purposes, I would like to mention a Chinese-language podcast I have discovered recently: [故事FM](https://storyfm.cn/) (Story FM). All of the episodes that I have listened to have been good, but #251 and #521 are excellent. This is not a “learn to speak Chinese” podcast, but a podcast for Chinese speakers, inspired by This American Life, so it is not easy—but it is worth the effort.  
  
​Enjoy!
