Happy New Year!  
  
Our first addition to the site this year is a slight departure from what we've published to date. Tsinghua sociologist Guo Yuhua is an important public intellectual and contributor to discussions of the China Dream, but her "[Original Intentions Start with the People](/guo-yuhua-original-intentions/)" is a blog post critical of Beijing municipal authorities, which was quickly taken down by authorities. This text thus stands of an example of what can no longer be said publically in China. The text also signals our intention to begin to address the gender gap in the visible world of Chinese public intellectuals. Enjoy!
