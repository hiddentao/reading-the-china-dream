New on the site this time:  
  
Only one piece, unsurprisingly on Trump's re-election:  
  
Xiao Gongqin, "[As Trump Assumes Power, How Will China Respond to the Challenge?](/xiao-gongqin-on-trump-20/)"  
  
Personally, Trump's victory has me flirting with a vow of silence, so I will stop there.  
  
Enjoy!
