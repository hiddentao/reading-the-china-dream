​New on the site this fortnight:  
  
Two short texts from sociologist Sun Liping on recent issues in China—China’s aspirational “[three child policy](/sun-liping-on-the-third-child/)” and the phenomenon of “[lying flat](/sun-liping-on-lying-flat/).”  
  
Also, [Qian Liqun](/qian-liqun-we-need-the-village/) on the relationship between Chinese intellectuals and China’s rural villages over the course of the 20th century.  
  
Finally, New Confucian Kang Xiaoguang and New Left political scientist Wang Shaoguang discuss China’s [Third Sector](/kang-xiaoguang-and-wang-shaoguang-on-chinas-third-sector/), a text from 2011 that makes us think about where China’s civil society is (or is not) headed.  
  
Enjoy!
