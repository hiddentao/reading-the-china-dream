New the site this time, three recent essays on Sino-American relations:  
  
Gan Yang, “[Thucydides and the ‘Thucydides Trap’](/gan-yang-ldquothucydides-and-the-lsquothucydides-traprsquordquo/)”;  
  
Liu Xiaofeng, “[The Historical Paradox of the Idea of the Great Atlantic Revolution](/liu-xiaofeng-on-the-paradox-of-the-atlantic-revolution/)”; and  
  
Jiang Shigong, “[Commerce and Human Rights, Part One: World Empire and the Roots of American Behavior](/jiang-shigong-on-commerce-and-human-rights/).”  
  
I particularly recommend Gan Yang’s piece, which is timely and thought-provoking.  
  
And for a change of pace, Selena Orly has translated an [interview](/interview-with-li-yinhe/) with the sociologist Li Yinhe, China’s leading scholar of sex and LGBTQ issues.  
  
I might note as well that the Center for Advanced Chinese Research’s [Party Watch Annual Report for 2021](https://www.ccpwatch.org/single-post/party-watch-annual-report-2021) has just come out. I was pleased to have been asked to contribute.  
  
​Enjoy!
