Two new translations on the site this fortnight. First, Chinese intellectuals discuss the Black Lives Matter movement in the US in the wake of the death of George Floyd (Xu Jilin, et. al., "[Reflecting on 'Black Lives Matter'](/xu-jilin-et-al-black-lives-matter/)"); and second, Lin Yao's rejoinder to Xu and co. (Lin Yao, "[I Beg to Differ](/lin-yao-i-beg-to-differ/)"), a brilliant analysis of what political correctness really means, in the US and elsewhere.  
  
Next time, back to perennial favorites, Cold War and/or covid.
