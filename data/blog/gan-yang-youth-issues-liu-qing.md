I am pleased to host the work of two guest translators this fortnight. Matthew Dean has translated an important 2006 interview with Gan Yang on “[The Modernity Critique of the 1980s and the Transformation of the 1990s](/gan-yang-ldquothe-modernity-critique-of-the-1980s/),” in which Gan offers his reflections on how he and China’s thought world have evolved over time.   
  
In addition, Freya Ge has translated a round table discussion of “[China’s Generation Z? What are _houlang_ and _houlang_ Culture?](/xu-jilin-houlang-and-houlang-culture/)” which addresses youth issues in contemporary China. Freya is an exceptional high school student in Shanghai who wrote me a few weeks ago wanting to contribute her translations to the site, and we are very pleased with the results of our inaugural effort.  
​  
Finally, I translated an [interview](/liu-qing-interview-with-southern-people-weekly/) with the well-known liberal Liu Qing in a Chinese equivalent of _People_ magazine, which I found interesting both in terms of form and content.
