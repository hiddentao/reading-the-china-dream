New on the site, well-known legal scholar Liang Zhiping on “[Imagining ‘Tianxia’: Building Ideology in Contemporary China](/liang-zhiping-tianxia-and-ideology/).” Like the Qin Hui piece on China and South Africa, Liang's text is very long, and I will publish it in installments over the next few months. When finished, we will have a comprehensive overview of the use and abuse of the tianxia concept by contemporary Chinese intellectuals.  
  
​Enjoy!
