New on the site:  
  
An interview with Gao Quanxi (on the right) and Huang Jisu (on the left), entitled “[Left and Right are Getting Along Just Fine](/gao-quanxi-and-huang-jisu-on-left-and-right-in-china/),” from a book by Xiao Sanza, _Standing with the Hedgehog_ (2016). The interview is quite interesting, as Gao rails against Chinese authoritarianism and Huang condemns China’s New Left as “statists who are flirting with fascism.”  
  
Only one text this time, but the end of the semester is approaching, which should free up more time for the site. I will be heading for China in May for the first time since December of 2018\. I will be in Beijing for the week of May 7, Shanghai for the week of May 14, and in Hong Kong for a few days before and after the China trip. If readers would like to meet up for a meal or a beer, send me a message!  
  
Enjoy!
