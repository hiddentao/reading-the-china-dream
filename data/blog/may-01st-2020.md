Three new additions to the site since last time, all related to the [coronavirus pandemic](/china-and-the-post-pandemic-world/):  
  
Zhao Yanjing, “[The Claims are Flooding in, and it is Urgent to Rebuild the Core Narrative of ‘China’s Fight against the Virus’](/zhao-yanjing-chinas-narrative/)” (April 10, 2020)

I am posting these texts as soon as the translations are finished, rather than at two-week intervals, but update messages will remain unchanged. We all get too much email as it is.
