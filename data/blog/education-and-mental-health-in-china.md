New on the site this time:  
  
Two articles that deal, in different ways, with China’s ongoing mental health crisis, and in particular its relationship to China’s high pressure educational system.  
  
Lei Wanghong, “[Tiger Mothers’ are Multiplying in Urban China because of the Epidemic of Success Education](/lei-wanghong-on-tiger-mothers/)”  
  
Zhang Han and Huang Siyun, “[After a Child is Diagnosed with Depression, an ‘Experiment’ that Seeks to Cure a Family](/beijing-youth-journal-on-teen-depression/)”  
​  
Other news: On October 3, I officially start my new life as an itinerant scholar/tourist with a two-week visit to Colombia, after which I will join my wife in Lausanne, Switzerland. Lausanne will be my European base, but I plan to travel frequently, and will be in Germany and France before returning to Canada in early December. In my travels, I would be delighted to meet with readers individually, or give a talk if they are at institutions where such things are possible. So I’ll be in Bogotá and Medellín between October 4 and 16\. I’m not holding my breath about finding many readers there, but will be meeting with China scholars at one of Bogotá’s universities. Then Lausanne from October 17\. Updates to follow.  
  
I’m also thinking of writing a travel blog, but will see if it is interesting before inflicting it on you.
