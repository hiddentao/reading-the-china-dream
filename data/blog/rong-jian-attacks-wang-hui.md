We are taking a break from the coronavirus this month (would that it would return the courtesy) to cover the Wang Hui-Rong Jian debate, an important event in China’s thought world in recent weeks. Wang Hui, China’s most prominent New Left intellectual, used the occasion of the 150th anniversary of Lenin’s birth to offer his musings on the possibilities of revolutionary renewal in his “[The Revolutionary Personality and the Philosophy of Victory: Commemorating Lenin’s 150th Birthday](/wang-hui-revolutionary-personality/).” Rong Jian, the Liberal independent scholar, fired back with two hard-hitting pieces: “[What Does the ‘Philosophy of Victory’ of the Revolutionary Mean? Criticizing Wang Hui’s ‘Revolutionary Personality’ and ‘Philosophy of Victory](/rong-jian-what-does-wang-hui-mean/),’” and “[Wang Hui’s ‘Heidegger Moment?](/rong-jian-wang-huis-heidegger-moment/)’”
