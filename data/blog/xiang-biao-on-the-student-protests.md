New on the site this time, “[Xiang Biao Talks about the Worldwide Student Movement, the Crisis of the Liberal Order, the Nearby and ‘Global Grassroots,](/xiang-biao-on-the-student-protests/)’” an example of how one Chinese scholar – who works in Germany – has experienced and understood the student demonstrations against the war in Gaza.   
  
The text is in fact in interview that Xiang gave to Wu Qi, the same journalist with whom he worked to put together his book _[Self as Method](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-19-4953-1)_. Xiang and Wu were both in Germany when the demonstrations – and the vigorous and conservative reactions to the demonstrations – occurred, and were shocked by the illiberal reactions of the universities, which should be core institutions of the liberal order. His argument, in a nutshell, is that the backlash against the demonstrations is a product of a larger failure of the postwar liberal global order. But his interview is more a reflection on what engaged, or “grassroots” scholars and activists should do in the face of an order that seems to be crumbling before our eyes. At present, the piece has been read 36,000 times in China.  
  
Enjoy the interview and your summer!
