New on the site: Cai Xia, "[Advancing Constitutional Democracy Should Be the Mission of the Chinese Communist Party.](/cai-xia-advancing-constitutional-democracy/)" The wrinkle here is that Cai was a professor (now retired) at the Central Party School, and develops her arguments out of the tradition of Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought. Enjoy.
