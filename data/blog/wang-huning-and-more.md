New on the site this time:  
  
A text by Wang Huning, Politiburo member and arguably China’s most powerful intellectual, “[Reflections on the Cultural Revolution and the Reform of China's Political System](/wang-huning-the-culture-revolution-and-reform-of-chinas-political-system/).” In fact, this is a 2012 revision of a text Wang originally wrote in 1986\. The translation is a collaboration between me and Matthew D. Johnson, Founder and Principal of [AltaSilva LLC](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnsonmatthewd). Matt and I will be offering more translations of Wang’s work in the coming weeks and months. Two texts are basically finished, and I discovered yesterday that several quite recent talks, interviews, and essays by Wang have been added to [Aisixiang](http://www.aisixiang.com/data/search.php?keyWords=%CD%F5%BB%A6%C4%FE&searchfield=author).  
  
In addition, for our Youth Concerns project, Freya Ge and I offer the translation of an interesting essay by Xiong Wenchun, “[Polarization: The Structure of the Education System Behind the Culture of Migrant Workers’ Children](/xiong-chunwen-the-education-of-migrant-workers-children/)”.  
  
​And finally, an addition to our Spanish-language translations: Xie Tao, "[2020: Las relaciones sino-estadounidenses y la política americana en tiempos de pandemia](/xie-tiao-2020-las-relaciones-sino-estadounidenses/)." Thanks to Ugo Armanini for his help in polishing the translation.
