New on the site this time:  
​  
Two texts inspired by the highly mediatized case of the “woman with eight children:” one, a brief [blog post](/sun-liping-on-the-woman-with-eight-children/) by the sociologist Sun Liping, attacking utilitarianism and reminding us of the importance of basic humanity; and another, longer [text](/zhang-yinghong-on-chinas-villages/), by Zhang Yinghong, a specialist in rural issues in China, that delves into the broader problems with rural governance that made the case possible.  
  
In addition, Mark Czeller, a Ph.D. candidate at Oxford, translates a fiery [piece](/li-fangchun-on-land-reform/) on land reform during the Chinese revolution by the historian Li Fangchun. Li calls out an older generation of Chinese scholars who, in his eyes, have sullied the heritage of China’s revolution by calling into question the competence of the Party and their over-reliance on Soviet models. As a companion text, Mark also translates part of a [lecture](/qin-hui-on-land-reform/) by Qin Hui, a popular figure on this site, as representative of the viewpoint Li Fangchun wants to criticize.  
  
For the next update, I will focus on how Chinese establishment intellectuals are responding to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. I have no doubt that many Chinese intellectuals are as shocked as many of us are about this horrifying turn of events. It will interesting to see what they actually say—or what they are allowed to say. See you mid-March.
