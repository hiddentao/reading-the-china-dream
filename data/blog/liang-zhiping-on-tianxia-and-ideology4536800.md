​New on the site this month, the final and complete version of Liang Zhiping’s “[Imagining ‘Tianxia’: Building Ideology in Contemporary China](/liang-zhiping-tianxia-and-ideology/).” Unlike those who preach the virtue of tianxia, Liang’s goal is to examine the role of the concept in the ideological reconstruction underway in China, the merging of Xi Jinping’s Socialism with Chinese Characteristics with the glories of traditional Chinese civilization. Because his essay was published on Taiwan (another shout out to _Sixiang_ and its wonderful editor, Qian Yongxiang), Liang was free(r) to discuss the role of Xi and the CCP in the process. Among the authors discussed: Zhao Tingyang, Jiang Qing, Sheng Hong, Yao Zhongqiu, Chen Yun, Wang Hui, Zhang Weiwei, Daniel A. Bell, Jiang Shigong, Gan Yang, Ge Zhaoguang, Xu Jilin, Chan Koonchung, Salvadore Babones, Shi Jian, Wu Jiaxiang, Wang Mingming...The piece is long but definitely worth reading, as it is up to date, objective, and fairly comprehensive, and provides a very useful framework for understanding tianxia discussions.
