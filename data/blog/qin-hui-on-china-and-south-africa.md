New on the site this month: Qin Hui, "[Looking at China from South Africa](/qin-hui-looking-at-china-from-south-africa-1/)" Part One. Those of you who enjoyed Qin's "[Dilemmas of Twentieth-First Century Globalization](/qin-hui-dilemmas/)" might remember remarks Qin made comparing apartheid South Africa to China in terms of their respective "economic miracles." These remarks drew on extensive research Qin has done on the subject, and which he published online in 2010\. The text is quite long--60 pages or so in Chinese ​when downloaded from the Internet--and we will publish an integral translation over the course of the summer, in serial form (5 or 6 installments). Enjoy!  
  
For those interested in the general topic of Chinese intellectuals, let me plug Sebastian Veg's excellent volume, _Minjian: The Rise of China’s Grassroots Intellectuals_, just out on Columbia University Press.
