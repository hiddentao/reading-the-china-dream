An [anonymous blog post](/anonymous-ldquoi-was-lucky-enough-to-live-through-a-jokerdquo/) by a young Shanghai woman that went viral in China (at least 1.7 million views) recounting, with bemused exasperation, her experiences in a quarantine center, in a hotel where “close contacts” were forced to isolate, and many misadventures in between. It is well worth a read, and if you want to know what “Schrödinger's lung” refers to, you’ll need to click through.
