New on the site : Hu Lianhe and Hu An’gang, “[How the Nationalities Question is Handled Outside of China](/hu-and-hu-nationalities-question/).” This text is somewhat different from our usual fare, which we see as “deep dives” into some of the best work of China’s establishment intellectuals. Hu Lianhe and Hu An’gang are establishment intellectuals, but their text is closer to an op-ed or a policy proposal than a closely reasoned scholarly argument. We translate and publish it here because of its connection to contemporary events in China: the confinement of as many as 1.5 million Uighurs in “re-education centers” in China’s far northwest. The text says nothing about such centers, but is surely a part of official (and intellectual) efforts to rethink policy on the nationalities question, and as such is a piece of a tragic puzzle many of us are trying to understand.
