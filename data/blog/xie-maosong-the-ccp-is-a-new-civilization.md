New on the site this time:  
  
​​Xie Maosong, “[The Chinese Communist Party is a New Civilization](/xie-maosong-on-the-ccp-as-a-new-civilization/).” This is propaganda, of course, and pretty dismal propaganda at that, but it seems appropriate to see what the standard-bearers are saying as Xi Jinping approaches his third mandate.  
  
Sun Liping, “[If Sheep Do Not Want to Be Tied Up, it is Not Necessarily because They Want to do Something Bad](/sun-liping-on-why-sheep-dont-like-to-be-tied-up/),” a somewhat whimsical reflection on Sun’s having been forbidden to publish online for three months over the Spring and Summer.  
  
Chen Jian, “[How Should We Evaluate Gorbachev?](/chen-jian-on-gorbachev/)” a short and surprisingly positive evaluation of the life and achievements of Mikhail Gorbachev on the occasion of his passing.  
  
Enjoy!
