New on the site this time, two texts:  
  
Xiao Sanza, “[Trumpism and the Future of China](/xiao-sanza-trumpism-and-the-future-of-china/).” This is a chapter from a book entitled _American Order: Trumpism as Understood by Chinese Conservatives_, an edited volume whose authors are all mainland Chinese intellectuals, published in Taiwan in the summer of 2021\. It is a book of advocacy, as all authors are full-throated supporters of Trump, despite the events of January 6, seeing him as the savior of Western civilization and thus the world. The book interests me because of research I am currently doing on how Chinese intellectuals view Black Lives Matter and Donald Trump. I don’t know if Trump fever has faded in China. I guess we’ll see as the 2024 American presidential campaign approaches.  
  
Xu Jilin, “[A Discussion: Does ChatGPT Signal the Birth of a New World, on the Beginning of the End](/xu-jinlin-on-chatgpt/)?” This roundtable is an example of the kind of discussions underway in China on ChatGPT, which strike me as quite similar to the discussions we read in Western media.  
  
​Enjoy!
