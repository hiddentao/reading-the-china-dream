​New the site this fortnight, an important recent essay by Jiang Shigong, "[The 'Critical Decade' in the Sino-American Relationship: the 'New Roman Empire' and the 'New Great Struggle.'](/jiang-shigong-ten-crucial-years/)" Jiang is a Professor of Law at Peking University, a New Left Intellectual, and an important spokesman for the Xi Jinping regime. This essay attempts to do the same thing for Sino-American relations as his 2018 essay on "[Philosophy and History](/jiang-shigong-philosophy-and-history/)" did for Xi Jinping Thought.
