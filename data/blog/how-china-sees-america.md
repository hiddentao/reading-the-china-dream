New on the site this fortnight, three translations of recent essays discussing China’s views of America, both in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, and the anti-racism protests provoked by the death of George Floyd.  
  
Xu Jinlin, "[Looking at American Political Correctness and Identity Politics through the Lens of the Anti-Racist Movement](/xu-jilin-political-correctness-and-identity-politics/)"  
[ ​](/yuan-ling-outside-beijings-sixth-ring-road/)Yuan Peng, "[Political Gamesmanship and American Chaos](/yuan-peng-political-gamesmanship-and-american-chaos/)"  
  
Yuan Peng**,** "[The Coronavirus Pandemic and a Hundred-Year Change](/yuan-peng-coronavirus-pandemic/)"  
  
I am also delighted to make available an essay by my Sino-French friend and scholar Ji Zhe, “[The ‘China Virus’ and its Mutation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hvZFLMzHMIUj7soF9XQtf8Z1QR-od36D/view?usp=sharing)”
