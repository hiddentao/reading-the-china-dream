New on the site this time, four new pieces on the war in Ukraine:  
  
​Gao Cheng, “[Is the Conflict Turning Around? How Russia and Ukraine Think Will Determine How Things Develop Moving Forward](/gao-cheng-on-russia-and-ukraine/)” introduced and translated by Selena Orly.  
  
Cui Zhiyuan, “[The ‘Security Dilemma,’ Constructivism, and the Ukraine Crisis](/cui-zhiyuan-the-security-dilemma-and-ukraine/)”​.  
  
Jin Yan, "[Regilding the Empire, Russia's 'New Empire Syndrome](/jin-yan-on-regilding-the-empire/)'".  
  
Shi Zhan, "[The First Metaverse War](/shi-zhan-the-first-metaverse-war/)".  
  
The texts are in descending order of conventionality, Gao Cheng’s being a fairly predictable defense of Russia that gives academic cover to the views of China’s authorities, and Shi Zhan’s being a very innovative discussion of the “networked mediatization” of the war.  
  
In addition, Freya Ge has translated a [piece](/luo-xiang-on-purchasing-women-and-children/) by Beida law professor Luo Xiang related to the case of the mother of eight discovered in January chained to the wall of an outbuilding in the suburbs of Xuzhou, who later was found to have been abducted and purchased. Luo gives popular online lectures about legal issues and cases and has some 13 million followers—mostly young people—on the video platform Bilibili, which makes his an important voice.  
  
Enjoy!
