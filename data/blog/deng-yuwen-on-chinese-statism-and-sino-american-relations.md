New this fortnight: Deng Yuwen, “[Chinese Statism, the Transitional Nature of Xi Jinping’s Regime, and America’s Response](/deng-yuwen-chinese-statism/),” Chinese text published on July 15, 2020 on a new European [site](https://www.chinese-future.org/), “China: History and Future 中国：历史与未来,” created by and for Chinese intellectuals living and working outside of China, hoping nonetheless to contribute to China's future development by providing critical commentary. Deng, a member of the Chinese Guomindang who also served as the editor of the CCP Central Party School journal _Study Times_ before being fired in 2013 (and who now is a Visiting Scholar at Nottingham University in England), offers a spirited essay discussing Sino-American relations and Xi Jinping as a "transitional" figure.   
Just one text this time around. It's summer.
