New on the site this time:  
  
Three texts that deal with American politics: Immigration, the “perils of pluralism,” Samuel Huntington, Trump and Trumpism, why the Western right-wing sympathizes with Putin…  
  
​Bao Gangsheng, Zhou Lian, Shi Zhan, and Liu Suli, "[The Pitfalls of Pluralism—Challenges and Crises of Contemporary Politics](/bao-gangsheng-on-the-pitfalls-of-pluralism/)”   
  
​Zhou Lian, “[Who are America’s Children: A Critique of Huntington’s _Who Are We_](/zhou-lian-on-huntington/)”   
  
Sun Liping, “[A Subplot in the Overall World Context](/sun-liping-on-putins-conservatism/)”   
  
I am also delighted to report that my translation of Xiang Biao and Wu Qi’s book, _[Self as Method: Thinking through China and the World](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-19-4953-1)_, has just been published by Palgrave MacMillan, with an introduction by yours truly. Excerpts of the book are available [here](/xiang-biao-excerpts-from-self-as-method/).  
  
I might also mention that the Center for Advanced China Research asked for my thoughts about important side-issues in China we might be missing as the world focuses on the 20th Party Congress. You can read my thoughts and those of other specialists [here](https://www.ccpwatch.org/single-post/perspectives-on-the-20th-party-congress).
