Back in the saddle again after ten days in the land of the (mask-) free and the home of the brave (vaccine-resisters). God bless boring, civilized Canada.  
  
New on the site this time, two texts by Yao Yang, whose apparent evolution from New Left to New Confucian I find interesting. The first text, “[The Challenges Facing the Chinese Communist Party and the Reconstruction of Political Philosophy](/yao-yang-on-rebuilding-chinas-political-philosophy/)” is particularly fascinating because it was published on July 2, the day after the CCP’s 100-year birthday bash, and offers Yao’s vision for China’s future, a vision which makes no mention of Xi Jinping or Xi Jinping Thought. Yes, I suppose that everyone had heard   _quite_ enough about Xi by then, but still, the omission is striking.  
  
Yao’s second text, “[The Dilemma of China’s Democratization](/yao-yang-on-chinas-democratization/),” dates from 2009, and is interesting because Yao seems already to be moving away from his earlier New Left standpoint.  
  
And finally, Freya Ge and I offer a [text](/qing-qingzi-on-yang-li/) that speaks to both Youth Concerns and Women’s Voices: a piece on the female stand-up comic Yang Li, and the online male backlash to her gentle ridicule of the foibles of (Chinese) men.  
​  
Enjoy!
