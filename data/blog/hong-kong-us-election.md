New on the site this fortnight, two texts where Mainland New Left intellectuals explain to Hong Kong Chinese the rationale for the National Security Law, imposed on Hong Kong by China's National People's Congress in May, 2020:  
  
Chen Duanhong, “[2020 National Constitution Day Symposium Keynote Speech: National Security and the Constitution](/chen-duanhong-national-security-and-the-constitution/)”  
  
Jiang Shigong, “[Probing the ‘Imaginary World’ and the ‘Real World’ to Understand the Internal Legal Logic of Hong Kong's National Security Law](/jiang-shigong-probing-the-imaginary-world/)”.  
  
Also, three short texts on the US election:  
  
Qin Hui, “[On the ‘Mainstream Media:’ Replies to a Guest’s Objections Concerning the U.S. Election](/qin-hui-on-the-us-election/)”  
  
Shi Zhan, “[How Many Tweets Would a Trump Thumb Tweet if a Trump Thumb Could Tweet Tweets?!](/shi-zhan-trump-and-twitter/)”  
  
Zhou Lian, “[Thoughts about Political Philosophy Inspired by the Total Blocking of Trump from Social Media](/zhou-lian-thoughts-about-political-philosophy/)”  
  
Enjoy!
