​New this fortnight: Zhang Qianfan, the controversial and outspoken law professor at Beijing University, on “[Left and Right in China and the West: A Trans-Oceanic Misunderstanding](/zhang-qianfan-left-and-right/),” a frank discussion of what liberal Chinese Trump fans are doing to Chinese liberalism; and Yan Xuetong's, “[Why and How to Prevent the Intensification of Ideological Disputes between China and the US](/yan-xuetong-how-to-prevent-ideological-disputes/),” a call by a major scholar of international relations for China to abandon Wolf Warrior diplomacy and return to the modest foreign policy that has served China well for forty years.
