Happy 2020!  
  
New on the site, Cao Jinqing, "[A Centennial Revival: The Historical Narrative and Mission of the Chinese Communist Party.](/cao-jinqing-a-centennial-revivial/)" Like Zhang Yongle's piece on "[The Harm of Studying Abroad](/zhang-yongle-the-harm-of-studying-abroad/)" published just before Christmas, Cao's text is relatively short, but interesting nonetheless. I happened across Cao while translating Liang Zhiping's _“_[Imagining Tianxia](/liang-zhiping-tianxia-and-ideology/)_,”_ where he is briefly discussed as contributing to the ongoing contemporary construction of an ideology built on tianxia and other ideas drawn from traditional Chinese political philosophy. The text is particularly interesting because while being predictably New Left and statist, it also appropriates traditional discourse to criticize certain shortcomings of the CCP.  
  
Enjoy!
