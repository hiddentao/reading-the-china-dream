New this time on the site:  
  
​Sun Liping on the [overproduction crisis](/sun-liping-on-overproduction/) in which China’s economy finds itself, and on the fact that only deep structural reforms will be of much help. This post was taken down by authorities and reposted elsewhere on the Chinese Internet.  
  
Cui Qinglong, a well-known psychologist and online commentator, on the [burnout phenomenon](/cui-qinglong-on-burnout/) in China and what to do about it.
