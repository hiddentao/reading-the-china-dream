New this month:  
​  
Liu Shao-hua, “[Disease Names and Stigma in the Context of the Pandemic](/liu-shao-hua-disease-names-and-stigma/)” (March 4, 2020)  
  
Jie Dalei, “[Ideology and Sino-American Strategic Competition](/jie-dalei-ldquoideology-and-sino-american-strategic-competitionrdquo/)” (May 9, 2020)  
  
Xiang Biao, “[The Theory of ‘Concentrated Mobility’ and the ‘Gyro-Economy:’ Understanding Social Change in China through SARS and the Coronavirus](/xiang-biao-concentrated-mobility/)” (May 21, 2020)  
  
Liu Shao-hua’s is the first piece from Taiwan on the site treating COVID-19.  
Readers who appreciated Yao Yang’s text on the [new Cold War](/yao-yang-the-new-cold-war/) will probably enjoy Jie Dalei’s as well.  
  
​Xiang Biao’s piece is a highly original essay connecting the coronovirus and its control with the general phenomenon of movement in China.
