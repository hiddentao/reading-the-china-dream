A couple of news items: Tim Cheek and I penned a piece on "[Making China Marxist Again](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/making-china-marxist-again-xi-jinping-thought)" that just came out in _Dissent_ magazine. Our text is largely based on Jiang Shigong's “[Philosophy and History: Interpreting the ‘Xi Jinping Era’ through Xi’s Report to the Nineteenth National Congress of the CCP](/jiang-shigong-philosophy-and-history/)”  
  
New to the web site this month: Xu Zhangrun, “[China’s Moment in World History: A 'Chinese Consciousness' Created by the 'China Problem'](/xu-zhangrun-chinas-moment/)". Xu is best known for his essay "[Imminent Fears, Immediate Hopes](http://chinaheritage.net/journal/imminent-fears-immediate-hopes-a-beijing-jeremiad/)" published this summer.
