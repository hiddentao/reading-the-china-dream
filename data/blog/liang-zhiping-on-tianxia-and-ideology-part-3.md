New on the site, part 3 of Liang Zhiping's "[Imagining 'Tianxia': Building Ideology in Contemporary China](/liang-zhiping-tianxia-and-ideology-part-3/)," in which Liang broadens his discussion even further to consider the writings of Xu Jilin, Salvatore Balbones, and Wang Mingming, among others. For new subscribers, or for those who lost the thread over the holidays, my introduction to Liang's piece is [here](/liang-zhiping-tianxia-and-ideology/). There are 20-25 pages left to translate, so I should be able to post the entire text in the coming weeks.
