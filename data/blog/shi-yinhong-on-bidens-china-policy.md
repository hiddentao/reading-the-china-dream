New on the site this time:  
  
A [gloomy assessment](/shi-yinhong-bidens-china-policy/)—from China’s perspective, anyway—of the first months of the Biden administration’s China Policy, by foreign policy expert Shi Yinhong.  
  
A fascinating [interview](/xu-jilin-redimensioning-the-enlightenment/) with Xu Jilin on what the Internet has done to the minds and personalities of China’s online youth, and how this has impacted the Enlightenment project of intellectuals of his generation.  
  
A short [text](/xu-xiaonian-two-china-models/) by the famed liberal economist Xu Xiaonian in which he criticizes Keynesianism and extols the virtues of Adam Smith’s invisible hand, presumably pushing back against some of the implications of current discussions of “common prosperity.”  
  
Finally, a video of a [virtual talk](https://youtu.be/Cb6ei65vfQs) I gave at the University of Oxford China Centre while I was in Germany in early October, together with Ingrid d’Hooghe and Xiang Biao.  
  
​Enjoy!
