New on the site this time:  
  
“[The _Beijing Cultural Review_ on the rise of Trump and the End of American Hegemony](/beijing-cultural-review-on-the-decline-of-american-hegemony/).” Here I translate the editorial introductions to five cover stories in the _Beijing Cultural Review_ between 2020 and 2023 on the topic in question, as part of a chapter I am writing for my book on how Chinese intellectuals view the United States. I look both at the issues involved and at the way the editors and authors shape these issues.  
  
In addition, a fascinating and well-done interview with the scholar-entrepreneur Liang Jianzhang on “[Why are Today’s Young People Not Having Children](/liang-jianzhang-on-chinas-looming-demographic-disaster/)?” Here, Liang is speaking as a demographer and talking about China’s imminent demographic disaster, the result of rapidly declining birth rates. Whether Liang is right or wrong, he is refreshingly frank, a reminder that not everyone in China is thinking only about Xi Jinping Thought.  
  
I have two book projects on which I need to make major progress over the next couple of months, so my contributions to my blog may be a bit less frequent. My impression is that people read less in the summer anyway, so it may make little difference.
