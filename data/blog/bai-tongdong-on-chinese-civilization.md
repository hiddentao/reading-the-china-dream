New on the site this time:  
  
Bai Tongdong, the New Confucian philosopher on “[The Margins of Civilization—Reflections on the Historical Position of Chinese Civilization and the Progress of Human Civilization](/bai-tongdong-on-chinese-civilization/),” in which the author pushes back against the oft-repeated notion that Chinese civilization is “unique” or “uniquely continuous.”  
  
Jiang Shigong, the prominent New Left thinker on “[The Rise of a Great Power and the Revival of Civilization: The Taiwan Issue and the ‘Enduring War of Civilization](/jiang-shigong-on-the-taiwan-problem/).’” Spoiler alert: I worked on this text for several days, thinking it was recent, only to discover that it was originally published in 2005 (the editors noted that the text had been recycled, but did not supply the date of original publication). The text is not without interest, but it is interesting for different reasons than had it been published after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  
  
Enjoy!
