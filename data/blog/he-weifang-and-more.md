New on the site this fortnight, an interview with the activist and legal scholar He Weifang, “[The Return of the True Scholar: A Reflection on the University](/he-weifang-the-return-of-the-true-scholar/)”. He has largely dropped out of sight in the past few years due to official pressure, and it is interesting to read him again, even if the subject is Republican-period universities.  
  
For our second installment on youth issues, Freya Ge and I are happy to offer the young literary scholar Liu Xinting’s bracing essay on “[Why are Contemporary Youth Increasingly ‘Unhappy?’ Focus on the Living Conditions of China’s Youth](/liu-xinting-contemporary-youth/),” a theory-rich discussion of the meme-play engaged in by young Chinese today.  
  
And finally, we add to our growing Spanish-language body of texts with Xu Jilin, "[¿Qué clase de civilización? China en una encrucijada](/xu-jilin-iquestque-clase-de-civilizacion/)," thanks to Cristina Reigadas.  
  
​Happy New Year, and enjoy!
