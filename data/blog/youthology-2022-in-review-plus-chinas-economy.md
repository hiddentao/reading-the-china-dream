​Happy Year of the Rabbit!  
  
New on the site this time:  
  
Youthology reflects on the youth experience of 2022 in “[The Year in Review: Growing up on the Margins](/youthology-2022-the-year-in-review/).”  
  
Also, two texts on the economy, surely the major theme in China now that zero-covid is a thing of the past.  
  
Sun Liping casts doubt on China’s capacity to grow internal demand in his “[Three Views of the Domestic Demand Question](/sun-liping-on-domestic-demand/)”  
  
Jia Jun, Wen Juan, and Shi Dong offer their thoughts on China’s high-tech strategy in the post- globalization age in “[Two Charter Planes, one from Jiangsu-Zhejiang, the other from Taiwan, Paint the Grimmest Metaphor of the Next Thirty Years](/jia-jun-et-al-on-chinas-high-tech-after-globalization/)”   
  
Enjoy!
