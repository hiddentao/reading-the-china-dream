Happy 2023!  
​  
New on the site this time, three snapshots of life in China since the end of covid-zero:  
  
Tian Xuan and Xue Zhaofeng on [price gouging](/covid-and-price-gouging/);  
  
V Shanshan (a screen name) on [covid, grieving, and forced solidarity](/v-shanshan-why-are-you-forcing-me-to-embrace-solidarity/);  
  
Sun Liping on [where China’s experts went wrong](/sun-liping-whats-wrong-with-our-experts/).  
  
For readers in the Washington D.C. area, I will be speaking at an event this coming Wednesday, January 18, together with Jude Blanchette and Nadège Rolland. The event is organized by Tanner Greer of the Center for Strategic Translation, and is entitled: "Politics Through Chinese Eyes: Reading China’s Establishment Intellectuals to Understand Chinese Politics.”  
  
Details: Holeman Lounge, National Press Club, 529 14th St NW, Washington D.C. 2:00-4:30\. You can register to attend [here](https://lu.ma/cst-press).
