​New on the site this time:  
  
A snide commentary on people complaining about the Shanghai lockdown by China cheerleader Zhang Weiwei: “[Say No to ‘Spiritual Americans.](/zhang-weiwei-on-spiritual-americans/)’”  
  
An interesting piece on “absentee farmers”—i.e., the millions of villagers who have moved to China’s cities during reform and opening: Huang Zhihui, “[From Absentee Landlords to Absentee Farmers: The Transformation of Farmers’ Living Patterns and Rural Revitalization in the Context of Reciprocal Relations between Towns and Villages](/huang-zhihui-on-absentee-farmers/).”  
  
Another piece on online youth culture, meant to complement the last update’s texts on the Industrial Party (see [here](/lu-nanfeng-and-wu-jing-on-the-industrial-party/) and [here](/zhou-anan-and-wu-jing-on-like-a-flowing-river/)): Pan Nini, “[How the ‘Little Pinks’ were Born: Analyzing ‘Fan Patriotism’ in the Internet Era.](/pan-nini-on-little-pinks/)”  
  
Enjoy!
