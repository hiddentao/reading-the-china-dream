New on the site this time, a Chinese feminist [reflection](/zhang-hong-on-alice-munro/) on the late Alice Munro's fall from grace, following revelations that Munro learned that her second husband had sexually abused her daughter from a previous marriage a decade or so after the fact, but remained with her second husband and kept silent about the abuse throughout the rest of her life. There is nothing distinctively Chinese about the text I chose to translate, but that is precisely the point: Alice Munro has readers in China who think about her much as everyone else does.

I'm off to China on Friday for a month. I'll be in Shanghai August 31 and September 1, 26, and 27; in Nanjing between September 2 and 6; in Beijing between September 7 and 13; then in Shandong, Sichuan, and Qinghai for the rest of the month (because I haven't visited anywhere except Beijing and Shanghai for the past 15 years, or so it seems). Send me an email if you want to meet up!
