New on the site this time:  
  
​Yao Yang on [common prosperity](/yao-yang-on-common-prosperity/), arguing that China should continue to let markets and entrepreneurs work their magic, but that China’s educational system should be reformed to level the playing field.  
  
For our Youth Concerns project, Freya Ge and I translated a rousing article by Yu Liang on China’s [Little Pinks](/yu-liang-on-little-pinks/), in which he connects this incarnation of China’s new nationalism less to patriotic education and more to online fan clubs.  
  
Finally, for our Women’s Voices project, Selena Orly and I translated a [provocative essay](/chen-yaya-on-single-mothers/) by the feminist activitist Chen Yaya, who argues that China might see its birth rate rise if it made it easier for single mothers to have children.  
  
A housekeeping note: the last time I updated the site, I received a couple of messages from readers who said that Avast had identified certain weblinks as possible “phishing” expeditions. I contacted Avast, and they replied in effect that “that happens sometimes.” If it keeps happening, send me a screen shot with the Avast warning and I will forward it to them. They would like to avoid false positives if possible.
