New on the site, Li Sipan, "[Why Don't Mainland Chinese Liberals Support Women's Rights](/li-sipan-chinese-liberals-on-womens-rights/)? This text, recommended to us by Qian Yongxiang, editor of the Taiwanese journal _Sixiang,_ is part of our effort to broaden the scope of our project to include more than the loudest voices. Li, a journalist and feminist activist offers a nuanced critique of Chinese liberalism's failure to engage with feminist concerns.   
  
For those looking for more in the same vein, we would like to endorse Lisa's Rofel's brilliant edited translation of a series of Dai Jinhua's recent essays, entitled [After the Post-Cold War: The Future of Chinese History](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1478000384/?tag=newbooinhis-20).  
  
​Enjoy.
