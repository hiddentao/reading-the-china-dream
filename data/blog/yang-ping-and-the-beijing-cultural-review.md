​New on the site this time, an [interview](/yang-ping-on-beijing-cultural-review/) with Yang Ping, editor of the _Beijing Cultural Review_, arguably contemporary China’s most important intellectual review – Yang himself has compared his journal to _The Atlantic_. The interview is a fascinating illustration of what is possible in contemporary China’s intellectual world, but also of the compromises that are required.  
  
I’m home in Switzerland now after a lovely month-long tour of Latin America (Mexico, Colombia, Peru). I’ll be giving a series of talks in Germany in a couple of weeks, and between April 14 and 26 will be in Halle, Würzburg, Göttingen, Berlin, Heidelberg, and Stuttgart, mostly as part of the project “[Worldmaking from a Global Perspective: A Dialogue with Chin](https://www.worldmaking-china.org/veranstaltungen/travelling-workshop-a-china-we-can-talk-to.html)a,” sponsored by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The cover title for my talks is: “A China we can talk to?”
