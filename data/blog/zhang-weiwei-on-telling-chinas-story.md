On the centenary celebration of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, four new texts:  
​  
[Zhang Weiwei](/zhang-weiwei-on-telling-chinas-story/) on telling China’s political story well. Zhang is a major cheerleader for the regime, and his text fits well with today’s celebration.  
​  
In addition to Zhang, two texts by Party-loyal public intellectuals that could have joined in the birthday bash, but for obscure reasons did not:  
  
[Yao Yang and Qin Zizhong](/yao-yang-and-qin-zizhong-on-confucianism-and-inequality/) on how Confucianism can solve modern problems of inequality;  
  
[Fang Ning and Feng Jungong](/fang-ning-and-feng-jungong-on-post-xiaokang-chinese-society/) on how the achievement of a “moderately prosperous society” might lead to post-modern challenges to China’s socio-political order.  
  
Finally, for our “Chinese Youth Concerns” project, [Yang Xiong](/yang-xiong-on-educational-involution/) on “educational involution.”  
  
There are signs that the US-Canadian border might reopen soon. If it does, I might well take a week or two off and go visit my mother, whom I have not seen since the beginning of the pandemic. In any event, I did the math and discovered that I have published, with the help of several colleagues, over 1,000 pages of material on my site since the beginning of this year, an (obsessive?) devotion to duty that surely earns me a brief holiday from text-hunting, translating, and proof-reading. If you don’t hear from me until August 1, you’ll know why. Stay cool and stay safe.
