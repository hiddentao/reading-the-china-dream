New on the site: Constitutional scholar Gao Quanxi on "[The Political Maturity of Chinese Liberalism](/gao-quanxi-political-maturity/)," by which he of course means the political _immaturity_  of Chinese liberalism. Not as rousing as Qin Hui on globalization and China's "low human rights advantage," but a text that many Chinese liberals see as one of the most important of the past few years. Enjoy!
