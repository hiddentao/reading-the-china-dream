New on the site this time:  
  
​More on Yao Yang, this time his “Confucian pragmatism.”  
  
Yao Yang and Qin Zizhong, "[An Analysis of Confucian Liberalism](/yao-yang-and-qin-zizhong-on-confucian-liberalism/)," which is a long, scholarly text, designed to show other intellectuals they know what they are talking about.  
  
Yao Yang, “"[Rebuilding China's Political Philosophy](/yao-yang-rebuilding-chinas-political-philosophy/)," a shorter text which covers some of the same themes, but which is more political and cast toward a more general audience.  
  
Yao Yang, "[The End of Ideology?](/yao-yang-on-the-end-of-ideology/)", an earlier text, which precedes Yang’s Confucian turn, illustrating some of the thoughts that led him in that direction.
