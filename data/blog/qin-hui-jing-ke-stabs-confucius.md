New on the site this fortnight: Qin Hui, "'[Jing Ke Stabs Confucius' and 'Zilu Sings the Praises of Qinshihuang.](/qin-hui-jing-ke-stabs-confucius/)'" Drawing on arguments advanced in his _Leaving the Imperial System Behind,_ banned in 2015, Qin offers ascerbic commentary on conservative attempts to rewrite modern Chinese history, as well as on China's contemporary intellectual scene in the summer of 2020.
