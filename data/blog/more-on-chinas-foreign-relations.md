New on the site this fortnite, two texts on China’s foreign relations by senior members of Beijing’s international relations elite : Shi Yinhong, “[The U.S. and Other Major Countries' Policies Toward China and the Future World Configuration](/shi-yinhong-future-world-configuration/),” and Wang Jisi, “[Abandon the Conventions of Great Power Relations to Grasp the Framework of International Trends](/wang-jisi-abandon-conventions/)”. [Sinocism](https://sinocism.com/)’s Bill Bishop observes that neither Shi nor Wang seems to have the ear of Zhongnanhai, but the texts are interesting nonetheless.  
  
We are also adding three new texts to our Spanish-language section. China is increasingly important throughout Latin America, but there is not a great deal of academic study devoted to China, and Spanish-language commentary is fairly rudimentary, so, ¡ándale! I will create a separate menu for these texts once we have a critical mass.   
  
Nicolás Cornejo has joined the team as a second translator. He studied political science at Tres de Febrero University in Argentina, is interested in the intellectual history of Republican China and contemporary intellectual debates. He is currently learning Chinese in preparation for study in China.
